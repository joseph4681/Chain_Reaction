# Chain_Reaction
Chain Reaction Game - Python - Kivy

A strategy game for 2 players.

The objective of Chain Reaction is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' bubbles.

Players take it in turns to place their bubbles in a cell. Once a cell has reached critical mass the bubbles explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra bubble and claiming the cell for the player. A player may only place their bubbles in a blank cell or a cell that contains bubbles of their own colour. As soon as a player looses all their bubbles they are out of the game.
